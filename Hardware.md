Hardware Materials required to build a working real-life prototype for the project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>> Basic Materials for the Parking System:

1. Arduino UNO
2. IR Sensors - 2pcs
3. Bread Board
4. Jumper wires - (Male to Female & Male to Male) - 20-30
   (Can connect according to the circuit image shared in the repository.
5. Servo motor- (I suggest 6V ones as they are best for small prototypes) - 1pc
6. Laptop to Arduino connector (wire)
7. Plastic Barrigate for entry and exit - 1pc
8. (Small mini Cars - Hotwheels or any other)

>>>> Materials for the Energy generation demonstration:

1. Phizoelectric Sensors (according to your parking size in the prototype
2. Black and Red wires (for connecting sensors to bulb for energy generation demonstration)
3. 5mm Led light bulbs
